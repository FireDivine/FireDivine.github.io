    <h2 class="title is-4">Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">
      What is your long term goal or career pathway
    </h3>
    <p>
      i want a career that is either in web developement or in database
      development
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">
      Strengths and limitations concerning learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      a limitation for me would be trying not to make everything perfect and
      knowing that things will take longer than planned.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">
      What non-technical skills would you like to see developed in yourself
    </h3>
    <p>more confidence in talking in front of people.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in the programme
    </h3>
    <p>
      if i think that i'll need more time to complete the work ,i will
      either ask for more or spend less time at work.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">
      Commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h3>
    <p>
      i will ask for help within 20mins of failing to find a answer to my
      problem or when confused.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">What i expect from the faciliatation team</h3>
    <p>
      just being able to help when im stuck and letting me know if ive
      missed something.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Scheduling Infomation</h3>
    <p>
      I have decided to work monday and tuesday and the rest of the week is
      for foundations. When bootcamp starts i will have the time off work.
    </p>

  <div class="container is-fluid">
    <h2 class="title is-4">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-5"> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I want as a ‘end game’ to go into full stack development, but if I can start by focusing on one part (database dev
      or front end dev ) and slowing go into the other half then this is also fine.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      My biggest limitation will be my communication. Over the last couple of years Ive grown much more inverted but
      speaking in front of any size group has never been my best.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strength would be my time management, I have learned that things usually will take double the time for me and
      so if I start earlier and still feel like I wont get there I can ask for help.

    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-5">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
      Most likely talking in front of people and hopefully I should be able to stay on top of the work that is given to
      me.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-5"> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself
      while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I would like to improve my mindset. I’ve gotten too used to having a fixed mindset. I would also like to improve
      giving feedback and receiving feedback.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-5"> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?.</h3>
    <p>
      Just the same as usual, to be around to help when/if I need it. Letting me know if I need to do some more work or if I should be doing some extra work in my ‘free’ time.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-5"> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      If I get stuck on something and no amount of googling or checking past questions can help me then to ask for it. I also want to go outside while on breaks instead of just sitting watching something. 
      To improve my explantations of things to make it easier for others to understand what Im talking about.
