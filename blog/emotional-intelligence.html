<p><em>Emotional Intelligence</em>is defined has growing the ability to be able to understand emotions and use/manage them as able.  </p>
<p>The difference between <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> and<em> Normal Intelligence</em> is that emotional intelligence is more of an understanding of things while IQ is a knowledge based assessment. </p>
<p><em>Emotional Intelligence</em>is important for growth and knowing when what you have done has affected another person and how you can identify how they are now feeling. Identifying these emotions can help us make better choices, rather than using the feelings to push something that should have been left for a better time, or pushing someone to do something that are not ready for after they have expressed this.</p>
<p> I find this relevant to me as I sometimes change how I would talk to someone based on how they have reacted/talked about something. It also helps me get a idea of what kind of person they are.  At my job it lets me know whether Ive overstepped my place or if what Im explaining is being understood.</p>
