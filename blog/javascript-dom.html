      <!-- diff between HTML and CSS -->
      <h3 id="subtitle is-4">The Difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        HTML acts a structure for a website. its like walls in a house. while
        CSS is used to place the HTML in the correct places. so CSS would be the
        builders who put the walls in the correct location acording to the plan
        they have.

      <p></p>

      <!-- What is the DOM and a example of interaction -->
      <h3 id="subtitle is-4 ">What is the DOM?</h3>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is where javscript can either change/add
        certain language elements/styles to a HTML 'page'.
      </p>
      <!-- Diff between accessing data from arrays and objects -->
      <h3 id="subtitle is-4 ">
        Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
      </h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are used to hold certain values under a single name. They are
        made in the square brackets “[ ]” Counting the index of a array starts
        at 0 like most programming concepts. Loops are used to access arrays,
        this way is to check all the values to find the value that is needed.
        Arrays are able to hold any type of values. Int, decimal, string ,
        objects. They can be connected into other arrays as well. <br /><code
          >var bob = [“Mary”,”Jane”]
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Objects are used to store information about a item. Objects use ‘curly’
        brackets “{ }” to be defined in JS.
        <br />
        <code> new Products = { name:”milk”, stock: 6, price:3.20} </code>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        From here you get the name by going product.name and it will output
        “milk”. Objects are used in databases such as <em>Mangodb</em> and
        <em>SQL</em> etc. Objects can have a entity that is a Array as well as
        shown below:
        <br />
        <code
          >new Products={ name:”milk”, stock: 6, price:3.20, type:[‘almond',
          'full', 'lite'] }
        </code>
        <br />
        Both arrays and objects are super useful for storing information for
        later use.
      </p>

      <!-- what are functions - how are they helpful -->
      <h3 id="subtitle is-4 ">What are functions? How are they helpful?</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are used to tell the programme instructions. It defines the
        method it is doing. Like if you were going to get the mail from the
        mailbox, your function would be called getMail and then have
        instructions on how you are doing that. It would then called in ur main
        function (“daily schedule”) which could also inculde makeDinner etc.
        functions help clean up a lots of mess that would have otherwise been
        all in one area, this makes the code easier to read and find the point
        which you want to fix or change. Example of a function : <br />
        <code> function getMail( ){ … } </code><br />
        <code>function makeDinner(type){
          ...}
        </code><br>
        They are then called by just going<br />
        <code>getMail() </code> <br />or if you are calling the function for say
        a button event then u can just go<br />
        <code>document.getElementById('dinner').onclick = makeDinner </code>
        <br />
        This doesn’t use the brackets as it wants the function to be called only
        when we click the button.
