    <p>
      <strong><em>Neuroplasticity</em></strong> is the rewiring of the brain where the brain can be changed throughout
      life by doing tasks with repeating the task or making the task harder to improve.

    </p>
    <h3>Understanding the Principles of Neuroplasticity benefits</h3>
    <p>
      The benefits of understanding the principles will teach people that the saying “you can do whatever you set your
      mind
      to” is true. With enough learning and repetition you will be able to anything. If you use a skill then you are
      improving it with time and repeating it. Otherwise the if you go for a length of time without doing the skill then
      slowly you will forget how to do it.
      For me this was coding after leaving university, I didn't practice as much as I did while in study and slowly
      forgot
      how to do most things as I was confusing on getting the processes at work improved in my brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will engage in this by repeating some exercises each week to an effort to make the process better for me to
      understand.
      This will mean I will able to set assign a few hours each week and do a project from the start to end. If I do it
      without looking at the previous weeks version until after I've finished then I might find I do it a different way
      or
      faster each time.
    </p>
    <h3>Ways to increase Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do some coding each day</li>
      <li>Repeat a task the way for a few mins each day or week to engage the brain to learn the way.</li>
      <li>Change my outlook on certain subjects to try make them more interesting. This way I wont dismiss it as quickly
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

      <strong><em>Growth mindset</em></strong> is how we engage with learning. A growth mindset believes that they can
      improve and looks to see how they can improve. While most of us are in a ‘fixed’ mindset, where we need to
      show/give ourself praise and get people to tell us we are smart/intelligent.
    </p>
    <h3>Surprises</h3>
    <p>
    I learned that most of the people I know most likely have the fixed mindset due to the way we were brought up.
    </p>
    <h3> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey</h3>
    <p>
    I will try to look at other ways I could do something, to challenge myself to find something new and learn from it.
