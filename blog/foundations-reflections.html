    <h1 class="title is-1">Foundations Reflections</h1>

    <h3 class=" subtitle is-4">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core
      learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I learned that had my current job I most def have a fixed mindset. This is most likely due to process we have to
      follow.

    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle is-4"> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h3>

    <p> Self awareness lets you asset situations and determine if your values and skills are useful for it. Empathy
      helps you learn what other people are feeling.
      This is useful in programming as it can help gage whether someone wants your help or if a client does actually
      like your work..</p>


    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

    <p>
      The subjects were every interesting. I learned a lot about subjects I would have otherwise never known of.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>I feel like I struggled to explain them well or in depth for my blog posts. </p>


    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
      learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p> I think it is due to not ever one likes doing it and its good to have with you for the future. Employers may not
      always provide these aspects in a job, so it could be something we can bring to the table.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle is-4">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
      have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

    <p>
      It doesn't feel like a total waste of time. I was still learning about new topics which is nice. I mostly did the
      core learning part after doing all the coding excerises so most of my time was spent programming anyway. Doing the
      core learning helped me learn a bit more about myself and how my actions can affect other people.

    </p>
